# Mini-Golf-With-Turtle-Graphics
A Minigolf game coded in python using the library Turtle graphics

Fun mini-golf game coded with the turtle graphics library in python! Click and drag the ball with your mouse to aim the ball. Once you release your hold, the ball will be launched in the opposite direction. The ball bounces on any white obstacles and if it is on top of the hole, then it goes in and you have finished the game! Click 'r' to reset the course in the middle of your round.

To improve your highscore, try to finish the course in the least amount of tries possible. Note that randomization of the course is entirely up to your luck!

Try to get hole in 1 . . .
